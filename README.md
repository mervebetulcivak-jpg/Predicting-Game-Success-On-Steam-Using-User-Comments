# Predicting-Game-Success-On-Steam-Using-User-Comments
This project aims to predict the success of games on Steam using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment Analysis was conducted on game data to visualize success criteria.

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS (IMPORTANT):

To ensure the data files load correctly, please follow these steps strictly:

1. Unzip/Extract the downloaded project folder ("SteamProject") to your computer (e.g., Desktop).

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook.

3. Inside the Jupyter interface, navigate specifically to the unzipped "SteamProject" folder.

4. Open the "Final_Project.ipynb" file located inside that folder.

5. Click "Run All" from the top menu.

(Note: If the notebook is not opened from within the project folder, it may fail to find the 'data' directory.)

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Due to a technical limitation with the source dataset (Kaggle), the "Reviews" (User Comments) file was unavailable. To demonstrate the functionality of the NLP algorithm, the sentiment analysis was performed on "Game Descriptions" instead. The code architecture is designed to function seamlessly with user review data once it becomes available.
